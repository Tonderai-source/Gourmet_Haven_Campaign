# Gourmet_Haven_Campaign
Gourmet Haven seeks to refine the effectiveness of its marketing campaign strategies. Specifically seeking to maximize profit for their 
next direct marketing campaign by having a better understanding of customer behaviours whilst optimizing target strategies plus enhanced campaign performance.

 ## BIG QUESTION
• Why do some customers accept marketing campaigns while others do not?
• This analysis explores key customer behaviors that explains customer-to-business interaction.

This project also seeks to evaluate features that influence whether the customers accept the campaign or not through deploying Machine Learning techniques such as Logistic Regression (including foward selection and backward selection), Lasso and XGBOOST.
